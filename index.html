  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>By Nadav Har’El</strong></p>

<p>A year ago, we reported (see <a href="http://osv.io/blog/blog/2015/02/02/mikelangelo/">Researching the Future of the Cloud</a>) that ScyllaDB and eight other industrial and academic partners started the <a href="https://www.mikelangelo-project.eu/">MIKELANGELO</a> research project. MIKELANGELO is a three-year research project sponsored by the European Commission&rsquo;s <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/">Horizon 2020</a> program. The goal of MIKELANGELO is to make the cloud more useful for a wider range of applications, and in particular make it easier and faster to run high-performance computing (HPC) and I/O-intensive applications in the cloud.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.scylladb.com/img/project-mikelangelo-logos.png" alt="company logos" /></p>

<p>Last week, representatives of all MIKELANGELO partners (see company logos above, and group photo below) met with the Horizon 2020 reviewers in Brussels to present the progress of the project during the last year. The reviewers were pleased with the project’s progress, and especially pointed out its technical innovations.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.scylladb.com/img/project-mikelangelo-people.jpeg" alt="project participants group photo" /></p>

<p>Represented by Benoît Canet and yours truly, ScyllaDB presented <a href="http://www.seastar-project.org/">Seastar</a>, our new C++ framework for efficient yet complex server applications. We demonstrated the sort of amazing performance improvements which Seastar can bring, with ScyllaDB &ndash; our implementation of the familiar NoSQL database <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org">Apache Cassandra</a> with the Seastar framework. In the specific use case we demonstrated, an equal mixture of reads and writes, ScyllaDB was 7 times faster (!) than Cassandra. And we didn’t even pick ScyllaDB’s best benchmark to demonstrate  (we’d seen even better speedups in several other use cases). Seastar-based middleware applications such as ScyllaDB hold the promise of making it significantly easier and cheaper to deploy large-scale Web or Mobile applications in the cloud.</p>

<p>Another innovation that ScyllaDB brought to the MIKELANGELO project is <a href="http://osv.io/">OSv</a>, our Linux-compatible kernel specially designed and optimized for running on cloud VMs. Several partners demonstrated running their applications on OSv. One of the cool use cases was aerodynamic simulations done by <a href="http://www.xlab.si/">XLAB</a> and Pipistrel. <a href="http://www.pipistrel.si/">Pipistrel</a> is a designer and manufacturer of innovative and award-winning light aircraft (like the one in the picture below), and running their CFD simulations on the cloud, using OSv VMs and various automation tools developed by XLAB, will significantly simplify their simulation workflow and make it easier for them to experiment with new aircraft designs.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.scylladb.com/img/aircraft.jpeg" alt="Pipistrel aircraft photo" /></p>

<p>Other partners presented their own exciting developments: Huawei implemented RDMA virtualization for KVM, which allows an application spread across multiple VMs on multiple hosts to communicate using RDMA (remote direct-memory-access) hardware in the host. In a network-intensive benchmark, virtualized RDMA improved performance 5-fold. IBM presented improvements to their earlier <a href="http://www.harel.org.il/nadav/homepage/papers/11760-atc13-harel.pdf">ELVIS</a> research, which allow varying the number of cores dedicated to servicing I/O, and achieve incredible amounts of I/O bandwidth in VMs. Ben-Gurion University security researchers implemented a scary “cache side-channel attack” where one VM can steal secret keys from another VM sharing the same host. Obviously their next research step will be stopping such attacks! Intel developed a telemetry framework called “snap” to collect and to analyse all sorts of measurements by all the different cloud components &ndash; VM operating systems, hypervisors, and individual applications. HLRS and GWDG, the super-computer centers of the universities of Stuttgart and Göttingen, respectively, built the clouds on which the other partners’ developments will be run, and brought in use cases of their own.</p>

<p>Like ScyllaDB, all partners in the MIKELANGELO project believe in openness, so all technologies mentioned above have already been released as open-source. We’re looking forward to the next year of the MIKELANGELO project, when all these exciting technologies will continue to improve separately, as well as be integrated together to form the better, faster, and more secure cloud of the future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>By David Jorm and Don Marti</strong></p>

<h2>Why build OSv images under Docker?</h2>

<p>Building OSv from source has several advantages, including the ability to build images targeting different execution environments. The <a href="https://cloudrouter.org">CloudRouter project</a> is working on integrating the build script into its continuous integration system, automatically producing nightly rebuilds of all supported OSv application images.</p>

<p>The main problem with this approach is that it requires a system to be appropriately configured with all the necessary dependencies and source code to run builds. To build a scalable and reproducible continuous integration system, we really want to automate the provisioning of new build servers. An ideal way to achieve this goal is by creating a Docker image that includes all the necessary components to produce OSv image builds.</p>

<h2>osv-builder: a Docker based build/development environment for OSv</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/cloudrouter/osv-builder/">osv-builder Docker image</a> provides a complete build and development environment for OSv, including OSv application images and appliances. It has been developed by <a href="https://github.com/abn/">Arun Babu Neelicattu</a> from <a href="http://iix.net">IIX</a>. To download the image, run:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>docker pull cloudrouter/osv-builder
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>OSv includes a range of <a href="https://github.com/cloudius-systems/osv/tree/master/scripts">helper scripts</a> for building and running OSv images. The build script will compile OSv from the local source tree, then create a complete OSv image for a given application, based on the application’s Makefile. For more on <code>scripts/build</code>, see <a href="http://osv.io/blog/blog/2015/04/08/makefile/">the recent blog post on the OSv build system</a>.</p>

<h2>Capstan</h2>

<p>The image comes with Capstan pre-installed. Note that to use Capstan, you&rsquo;ll have to run the container with the &mdash;privileged option, as it requires the KVM kernel module. For example, to build and run the iperf application:</p>

<h2>Launching an interactive session</h2>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span><span class='line'>  cloudrouter/osv-builder
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will place you into the OSv source clone.  You’ll see the prompt:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>bash-4.3#
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, you can work with it as you normally would when working on OSv source.  You can build apps, edit build scripts, and so on. For example, you can run the following commands, once the above <code>docker run</code> commands has been executed, to build and run a tomcat appliance.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>./scripts/build <span class="nv">image</span><span class="o">=</span>tomcat,httpserver
</span><span class='line'>./scripts/run -V
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>The <code>osv</code> Command</h2>

<p><strong>Note</strong> that the commands you run can be prefixed with <code>osv</code>, the source for which is available at <code>assets/osv</code>. For example you can build by:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>docker run <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>  --volume <span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">HOST_BUILD_DIR</span><span class="k">}</span>:/osv/build <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>  osv-builder <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>  osv build <span class="nv">image</span><span class="o">=</span>opendaylight
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The <code>osv</code> script, by default, provides the following convenience wrappers:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th align="left"> Command                                     </th>
<th align="left"> Mapping</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td align="left"> build <em>args</em>                                </td>
<td align="left"> scripts/build </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td align="left"> run <em>args</em>                                  </td>
<td align="left"> scripts/run.py</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td align="left"> appliance <em>name</em> <em>components</em> <em>description</em> </td>
<td align="left"> scripts/build-vm-img</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td align="left"> clean                                       </td>
<td align="left"> make clean</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>If any other command is used, it is simply passed on as <code>scripts/$CMD "$@"</code> where <code>$@</code> is the arguments following the command.</p>

<p>You could also run commands as:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>docker run <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>  --volume <span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">HOST_BUILD_DIR</span><span class="k">}</span>:/osv/build <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>  osv-builder <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>  ./scripts/build <span class="nv">image</span><span class="o">=</span>opendaylight
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Building appliance images</h2>

<p>If using the pre-built version from Docker Hub, use <code>cloudrouter/osv-builder</code> instead of <code>osv-builder</code>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">HOST_BUILD_DIR</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span><span class="nb">pwd</span><span class="k">)</span>/build
</span><span class='line'>docker run <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>  --volume <span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">HOST_BUILD_DIR</span><span class="k">}</span>:/osv/build <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>  osv-builder <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>  osv appliance zookeeper apache-zookeeper,cloud-init <span class="s2">&quot;Apache Zookeeper on OSv&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If everything goes well, the images should be available in <code>${HOST_BUILD_DIR}</code>. This will contain appliance images for <a href="http://wiki.qemu.org/KVM">QEMU/KVM</a>, <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Oracle VirtualBox</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/">Google Compute Engine</a> and <a href="https://www.vmware.com/">VMWare</a> Virtual Machine Disk.</p>

<p>Note that we explicitly disable the build of <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/esxi-and-esx/overview">VMware ESXi</a> images since <code>ovftool</code> is not available.</p>

<h2>Building locally</h2>

<p>As an alternative, you can build locally with a <code>docker build</code> command, using the <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/cloudrouter/osv-builder/dockerfile/">Dockerfile</a> for osv-builder.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>docker build -t osv-builder .
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then you can use a plain <code>osv-builder</code> image name instead of <code>cloudrouter/osv-builder</code>.</p>

<p>For more information regarding OSv Appliances and pre-built ones, check the <a href="http://osv.io/virtual-appliances/">OSv virtual appliances page</a>.</p>

<h2>Sending OSv patches</h2>

<p>If you’re following the <a href="https://github.com/cloudius-systems/osv/wiki/Formatting-and-sending-patches">Formatting and sending patches</a> guide on the OSv web site, just copy your patches into the <code>builder</code> directory in the container, and they’ll show up under your <code>$HOST_BUILD_DIR</code>, ready to be sent to the mailing list.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/osv-dev/x-E9YfzDz20">OSv 0.19</a> is out, with a rewrite of the build system. The old OSv build system was fairly complex, but the rewrite makes it simpler and faster.</p>

<h2>Simpler Makefile</h2>

<p>The old OSv build system had several makefiles including each other, playing tricks with the current directory and <code>VPATH</code>, dynamically rewriting makefiles, and running submakes.</p>

<p>The old <code>Makefile</code> was responsible not only for building the kernel, it also built tests, called various Python scripts to build modules for different applications, and carried out other tasks.</p>

<p>In the new build system, there is just one &ldquo;Makefile&rdquo; for building the entire OSv kernel. Everything is in one file, and also better commented.</p>

<h2>Separate kernel building from application building</h2>

<p>In the old build system, we used &ldquo;make&rdquo; to do everything from building the OSv kernel, building various applications, and building images containing OSv and a collection of applications. This complicated the <code>Makefile</code>, and resulted in unexpected build requirements. For example, building OSv always built some Java tests and thus required Maven and a working Internet connection).</p>

<p>In the new system, <code>make</code> only builds the OSv kernel, and <code>scripts/build</code>
build applications and images. In the future, you could use <a href="http://osv.io/capstan/">Capstan</a> instead of <code>scripts/build</code> to make an image that you would like to manage with Capstan.</p>

<p>Most <code>make</code> command lines that worked in the previous build system will
continue to work unchanged with <code>scripts/build</code>. For example:</p>

<pre><code># build image with default OSv application
scripts/build

# build the rogue image
scripts/build image=rogue
# or
scripts/build modules=rogue

# clean kernel and all modules
scripts/build clean

# make parameters can also be given to build
scripts/build mode=debug

# build image with tests, and run them
scripts/build check
</code></pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additional benefits of this rewrite include:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Faster rebuilds. For example &ldquo;touch loader.cc; scripts/build image=rogue&rdquo;
takes just 6 seconds (14 seconds previously). make after &ldquo;make clean&rdquo;
(with ccache) is just 10 seconds (30 seconds previously).</p></li>
<li><p>It should be fairly easy to add additional
build scripts which will build different types of images using the same
OSv kernel. One popularly requested option is to have the ability to
create a bootfs-only image, without ZFS.</p></li>
<li><p>Some smaller improvements, like more accurate setting of the desired image size <a href="https://github.com/cloudius-systems/osv/issues/595">(covered in issue #595)</a>, and supporting setting CROSS_PREFIX without also needing to specify ARCH.</p></li>
</ol>


<h2>What happened to <code>make test</code>?</h2>

<p>The OSv test are a module like other modules &ndash; they won&rsquo;t be compiled unless someone builds the <code>tests</code> module. They will have a separate Makefile in <code>tests/</code>. The <code>ant</code> and <code>mvn</code> tools, both currently used in our makefile just for building tests, will no longer be run every time the kernel is compiled, but just when the &ldquo;tests&rdquo; module is being built. To build and run the tests:</p>

<pre><code>scripts/build check
</code></pre>

<h2>Try it out</h2>

<p>The good news is that now, running <code>make</code> is faster, and the image build process is simpler and easier to extend. Check it out &mdash; questions and comments welcome on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/osv-dev">osv-dev mailing list</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>By David Jorm and Don Marti</strong></p>

<p>Most users are aware of cloud computing as a general term behind such trends as &ldquo;Software as a Service,&rdquo; where sites such as Salesforce.com can replace software run by a company IT department, or &ldquo;Infrastructure as a Service&rdquo; where virtual machines rented by the hour can replace conventional servers. But today, the technologies behind the cloud are changing the way that we connect the Internet at the most fundamental level, through Software Defined Interconnection (SDI).</p>

<p><strong>What is SDI?</strong> A lot of manual work goes into hooking up the Internet between providers. The routers that send Internet traffic from one place to another can be configured to use &ldquo;paid transit&rdquo;, where a single provider will route packets to any destination. But the more Internet traffic you’re responsible for, the more you can benefit from another arrangement, called &ldquo;direct interconnection&rdquo; where you set up your company’s routers to directly connect to another company’s. Most networks will always need to buy transit from somebody; the best you can hope for is that a portion of your traffic bypasses the transit provider and is directly delivered to the destination. Maximizing the amount of traffic that is directly peered leads to better performance, lower latency, lower packet loss, and greater security.</p>

<p>Today, most direct interconnection is typically set up manually, with a physical fiber cable connecting one organization’s network to another. Agreements to interconnect and peer are also reached manually, typically via email or face-to-face at peering conferences. When agreement is reached, network admins must ssh in to routers in order to manually configure such peering. It’s not efficient or scalable, and depends on individuals or select groups.</p>

<p>Once an organization has agreed that they want to directly connect with another organization, how do you handle changes to router and switch configuration? Probably the same way you used to manage your httpd.conf back in the 1990s! Network managers ssh in, and update config manually. Some networks have sophisticated management tools, but for many, &ldquo;the state of the router is the canonical state.&rdquo;</p>

<p><img src="http://www.cloudius-systems.com/images/iix_rack.png"
 alt="Software-defined interconnection"></p>

<p><em>Software-defined interconnection, under test in the IIX lab</em></p>

<p>SDI aims to improve all that. The OpenDaylight project is a common platform for network management that facilitates breaking traditional network devices such as switches and routers into separate &ldquo;data plane&rdquo; devices that handle high traffic volume and &ldquo;control plane&rdquo; devices that do management. Because the control plane device, or software-defined networking (SDN) controller, does not have the extreme throughput requirements of the data plane, it’s easy to virtualize.</p>

<p><strong>In the lab today</strong> IIX is currently prototyping this next generation of devices in the lab, while more traditional network gear runs in production. The prototype system uses an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenFlow">OpenFlow switch</a> for data plane, and a separate OpenDaylight server for control plane. Switches rely on the SDN controller. In the event of an unknown packet, they forward it to the controller.</p>

<p>No configuration changes are needed on the data plane hardware, only on the SDN controller, which can be a virtual machine. OpenDaylight manages both layer 2, switching, and layer 3, routing, and the same OpenDaylight APIs can be used to change configuration at both levels.</p>

<p>OpenDaylight is a pure Java application. It only requires the ability to run a JVM on the virtual machine. For security and ease of management, it can be advantageous to run an individual controller per customer. This means a lightweight, easy-to-manage guest OS is a big advantage. With OSv, IIX can deploy identical simple VMs for each customer, and the OpenDaylight APIs can be used to configure each one appropriately.</p>

<p>OSv’s high performance and low overhead allows for high density of VMs on standard physical hardware. And any compromise or configuration error should only affect one customer, because strong isolation is provided by a standard hypervisor, without the <a href="http://www.projectatomic.io/blog/2014/09/yet-another-reason-containers-don-t-contain-kernel-keyrings/">complex security model of containerization</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> While Internet applications have gained from cloud technologies, the fundamental lower layers are still coming up to speed. OpenDaylight and OSv are bringing cloud economics to the lower levels of the stack.</p>

<time datetime="2015-02-20T06:54:23-08:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 20<span>th</span>, 2015</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, we are releasing Seastar, a new open-source C++
framework for extreme high-performance applications
on OSv and Linux. Seastar brings a 5x throughput
improvement to web-scale workloads, at millions of
transactions per second on a single server, and is
optimized for modern physical and virtual hardware.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.seastar-project.org/img/memcache.png" alt="seastar Memcache graph" /></p>

<p><em>Benchmark results are available from the <a href="http://www.seastar-project.org/">new Seastar
project site</a>.</em></p>

<p><strong>Today’s server hardware is <a href="http://danluu.com/new-cpu-features/">substantially different</a> from
the machines for which today’s server software
was written.</strong> Multi-core design and complex
caching now require us to make new assumptions to
get good performance.  And today’s more complex
workloads, where many microservices interact to
fulfil a single user request, are driving down the
latencies required at all layers of the stack. On
new hardware, the performance of standard workloads
depends more on locking and coordination across cores
than on performance of an individual core. And the
full-featured network stack of a conventional OS can
also use a majority of a server’s CPU cycles.</p>

<p><strong>Seastar reaches linear scalability,</strong> as a
function of core count, by taking a shard-per-core
approach. SeaStar tasks do not depend on synchronous
data exchange with other cores which is usually
implemented by compare-exchange and similar locking
schemes. Instead, each core owns its resources (RAM,
NIC queue, CPU) and exchanges async messages with
remote cores. Seastar includes its own user-space
network stack, which runs on top of <a href="http://dpdk.org/">Data Plane
Development Kit</a> (DPDK). All
network communications can take place without system
calls, and no data copying ever occurs. SeaStar is
event-driven and supports writing non-blocking,
asynchronous server code in a straightforward
manner that facilitates debugging and reasoning
about performance.</p>

<p>Seastar is currently focused on high-throughput,
low-latency network applications. For example,
it is useful for NoSQL servers, for data caches
such as memcached, and for high-performance HTTP
serving. Seastar is available today, under the Apache
license version 2.0.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>By Nadav Har&#8217;El</strong></p>

<p>What will the IaaS cloud of the future look like? How can we improve the
hypervisor to reduce the overhead it adds to virtual machines? How can we
improve the operating system on each VM to make it faster, smaller, and
more agile? How do we write applications that run more efficiently and
conveniently on the modern cloud? How can we run on the cloud applications
which traditionally required specialized hardware, such as supercomputers?</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/mikelangelo.png" alt="Project Mikelangelo" /></p>

<p>Cloudius Systems, together with eight leading industry and university
partners, announced this month the <a href="http://mikelangelo-project.eu/">Mikelangelo</a> research project, which
sets out to answer exactly these questions. Mikelangelo is funded by the
European Union&rsquo;s flagship research program, <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/">&ldquo;Horizon 2020&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>Cloudius Systems brings to this project two significant technologies:</p>

<p>The first is OSv, our efficient and light-weight operating-system kernel
optimized especially for VMs in the cloud. OSv can run existing Linux
applications, but often with significantly improved performance and lower
memory and disk footprint.</p>

<p>Our second contribution to the cloud of the future is Seastar, a new
framework for writing complex asynchronous applications while achieving
optimal performance on modern machines. Seastar could be used to write
the building blocks of modern user-facing cloud applications, such as
HTTP servers, object caches and NoSQL databases, with staggering
performance: Our prototype implementations already showed a 4-fold
increase in server throughput compared to the commonly used alternatives,
and linear scalability of performance on machines with up to 32 cores.</p>

<p>The other companies which joined us in the Mikelangelo project are
an exciting bunch, and include some ground-breaking European (and global)
cloud researchers and practicioners:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&bull; <a href="http://www.mikelangelo-project.eu/consortium/huawei/">Huawei</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&bull; <a href="http://www.mikelangelo-project.eu/consortium/ibm/">IBM</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&bull; <a href="http://www.mikelangelo-project.eu/consortium/intel/">Intel</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&bull; <a href="http://www.mikelangelo-project.eu/consortium/hlrs/">The University of Stuttgart&rsquo;s supercomputing center (HLRS)</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&bull; <a href="http://www.mikelangelo-project.eu/consortium/gwdg/">The University of Goettingen&rsquo;s computing center (GWDG)</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&bull; <a href="http://www.mikelangelo-project.eu/consortium/ben-gurion-university/">Ben-Gurion University</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&bull; <a href="http://www.mikelangelo-project.eu/consortium/xlab/">XLAB</a>, the coordinator of the project</p>

<p>&nbsp;&bull; <a href="http://www.mikelangelo-project.eu/consortium/pipistrel/">Pipistrel</a>, a light aircraft manufacturer</p>

<p>Pipistrel&rsquo;s intended use case, of moving HPC jobs to the cloud, is
particularly interesting. Pipistrel is an innovative manufacturer of
light aircraft that holds <a href="http://www.pipistrel.si/media/achievements-and-awards">several cool world records</a>, and won NASA&rsquo;s
2011 &ldquo;Green Flight Challenge&rdquo; by building an all-electric airplane
achieving the equivalent of 400 miles per gallon per passenger.
The aircraft design process involves numerous heavy numerical
simulations. If a typical run requires 100 machines for two hours,
running it on the cloud means they would not need to own 100 machines,
and rather just pay for the computer time they use. Moreover, on the
cloud they could just as easily deploy 200 machines, and finish the
job in half the time, for exactly the same price!</p>

<p>Last week, researchers from all these partners met to kick off the
project, and also enjoyed a visit to Ljubljana which, as its name implies,
is a lovely city. The project will span 3 years, but we expect to see some
encouraging results from the project&mdash;and from the individual partners
comprising it&mdash;very soon. The future of the cloud looks very bright!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ian Briggs, Matt Day, Eric Eide, Yuankai Guo, and
Peter Marheine are conducting performance research
on unikernels, and have thoughtfully posted some
preliminary work on OSv performance.</p>

<p>The team tested OSv for DNS and HTTP, and got some
encouraging results.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/images/http-server-benchmark.png"><img src="/blog/images/http-server-benchmark.png" alt="HTTP server comparison" /></a></p>

<p>The lighttpd web server on OSv performs consistently
well up through 5000 requests/second.  And on DNS
tests, Linux can sustain a response rate of about
19000 per second, while OSv can handle approximately 28000 requests per second, with slightly
lower latency.</p>

<p>The preliminary paper is
<a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~peterm/prelim-osv-performance.pdf">Performance Evaluation of OSv for Server
Applications</a>
(<a href="/blog/images/prelim-osv-performance.pdf">local copy</a>).</p>

<p>The researchers did run into a bug running OSv
on Xen, so we&rsquo;re all looking forward to helping
them track that down on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/osv-dev">osv-dev mailing

<p>Hey, wait a minute. It&rsquo;s not a good idea to repeat yourself, especially for me, since I have to &ldquo;start a project&rdquo; often for demo code.  So here&rsquo;s a way to keep track of all those extre files in one place, with a few lines in Makefile and one handy git command.</p>
