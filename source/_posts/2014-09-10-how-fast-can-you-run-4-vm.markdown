**By Dor Laor, Tzach Livyatan**

In the following demo, Dor is running 4 different OSv base virtual appliances
on his laptop:

* Redis
* Tomcat
* MySQL
* Cassandra

Each virtual appliance is a fullâ€“blown VM, each with a pre integrated
cloud application, and each launched without terminating the others.

As you can see, application boot time take between sub-second
(Reids) to a few seconds (Cassandra) depending on the application.
The Hypervisor plus OS part of the boot time is less than a second for all cases.
